# 🏏 IPL Win Predictor
A Machine Learning-powered Streamlit web application that predicts the winning probability of an IPL match based on real-time inputs like teams, city, target score, current score, overs, and wickets.
🚀 Features
•	Predicts winning probability for batting and bowling teams.
•	Interactive UI built with Streamlit.
•	Uses Logistic Regression model trained with historical IPL match data.
•	Handles categorical data using OneHotEncoding.
## 📊 Inputs
•	Batting Team
•	Bowling Team
•	City
•	Target Score
•	Current Score
•	Overs Completed
•	Wickets Fallen
## ⚙️ Tech Stack
•	Python
•	Pandas
•	Scikit-learn
•	Streamlit

## 🧠 Model Info
•	Algorithm: Logistic Regression
•	Preprocessing: OneHotEncoding (Teams and City), numeric transformation (overs, score, etc.)
•	Target Variable: Match winner

## ✨ Output
The app shows the predicted winning percentage for both batting and bowling teams in real-time.
🧪 Example
Batting Team: Mumbai Indians
Bowling Team: CSK
City: Mumbai
Target: 180
Score: 100
Overs: 12
Wickets: 3
🔹 Mumbai Indians: 68%
🔸 Chennai Super Kings: 32%
## 📌 To Do
•	Improve model performance with more features
•	Add visualization support (matplotlib/seaborn/plotly)
•	Integrate live match data APIs
